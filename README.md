# 🚀 **Spring Security OAuth 2.0** Integration

## 📚 Overview

This repository demonstrates how to **secure your Spring Boot application** using **OAuth 2.0** for **authentication** and **authorization**. By leveraging **Spring Security** and OAuth 2.0, you can easily integrate with third-party OAuth providers (like Google, GitHub, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate users securely in your applications.

With OAuth 2.0, you don't have to worry about managing usernames, passwords, or session data. Instead, you can offload authentication to trusted providers, ensuring **stronger security** and better user management.
